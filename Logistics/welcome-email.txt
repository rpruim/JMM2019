Dear Minicourse Participant,

Shonda and I are looking forward to meeting you in Baltimore next week for one or both of the two minicourses we are co-leading:

  * Start Teaching Statistics with R and RStudio (Wednesday and Thursday)
  * Keep Teaching Statistics with R and RStudio (Friday and Saturday)

We hope you will also take advantage of the sessions sponsored by the SIGMAA StatEd.  You can find those details on your program.

As we prepare for our minicourses, we request that you fill out a brief survey to give us a bit of information about your background and the reasons you are interested in the minicourse.  You can find the survey here:

No additional preparation is required, but be sure to bring a laptop that can access wireless internet.

If you like, here are some additional things you may do in advance:

  * Create an account at rstudio.cloud.  This will give you access to a cloud-based RStudio.

  * If you want to have a locally installed version of R and RStudio on your computer, these are easy to install.  Just follow the directions at rstudio.com and cran.r-project.org.

  * If you want to try things on a local version of R and RStudio (again, this is not required for the minicourse), you will also want to install a number of R packages including mosaic, learnr, rmarkdown, and tidyverse.  (In RStudio, this can be done from the packages tab.  A number of additional packages will be installed as well.) Installing these in advance will save the download delay during the minicourse.

Thanks.
