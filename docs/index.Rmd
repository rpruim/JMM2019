### Day 1: The Less Volume, More Creativity approach

#### Goals for the day

* Consider what "Less Volume, More Creativity" looks like in your own
courses

* Learn how to create (multivariate!) graphical and numerical summaries
in R

#### Resources

## Additional Resources and Information

<!-- ## R Studio Server -->

<!-- You are welcome to use an account on Calvin's RStudio server using the username and password  -->
<!-- provided.  Here's the link to get there. -->

<!--   * [rstudio.calvin.edu](http://rstudio.calvin.edu) -->

<!-- These accounts will likely be recycled in May or June, 2018. -->

### Cheat Sheets

R Studio is assembling a number of useful cheat sheets at [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

### rstudio.cloud

You (and your students) can set up accounts with <https://rstudio.cloud/>.
This is the easiest way to get going with R since no one needs to install or 
pay for anything.

This online version of RStudio is a new service and still under development.
Currently it is free.  Eventually there may be both free and paid plans.


### Running R Locally

You are welcome to work in your own local copy of R and RStudio if you prefer.  This will work best if you have a recent versions 

  * [R](http://cran.r-project.org)
  * [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)
  * the [`mosaic`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`ggformula`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package and its dependencies
  
Packages can be installed or updated using the Packages tab in RStudio.


### Setting up your own RStudio Server  

 * If you ask, RStudio will provide you with the professional server for free for qualifying academic purposes.  Contact them for details to see if you qualify.
 
 * If you want to serve tutorials, you will also need to set up RStudio Connect (and maybe a shiny server).  These aren't any harder than setting up RStudio Server, but they are separate software installs.
 
 * RStudio has lots of documentation about how to install and configure. For example, here is the [RStudio Server Pro admin guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/)
 
 * Here's a [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-get-your-very-own-rstudio-server-and-shiny-server-with-digitalocean/) discussing how to do this with Digital Ocean.

 * Here's a [blog post](http://amunategui.github.io/EC2-RStudioServer/) about doing this with AWS.
