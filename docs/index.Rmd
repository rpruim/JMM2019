### Cheat Sheets

R Studio is assembling a number of useful cheat sheets at [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  Among many others, are these

* [mosaic cheat sheet](https://github.com/mlaviolet/Mosaic-cheatsheets/raw/master/mosaic-cheatsheet-gf.pdf)

### StatPREP

URL: <http://statprep.org/>

#### Regional Workshops
StatPREP will host four regional workshops in summer 2019 focused on helping
faculty learn to teach modern methods of data analytics in introductory
statistics courses. 

These workshops are open to any faculty member teaching post-secondary intro
stats over the next academic year. There is no registration fee for the workshop
and all workshop expenses are covered through support from the National Science
Foundation. Funds up to $100 are available for each participant to offset local
travel expenses.

* University of Hartford, Hartford, CT, May 31-June 1, 2019
* Howard Community College, greater DMV area, Washington, D.C, June 7-8, 2019
* Tarrant County College, Fort Worth, TX, June 14-15, 2019
* Highline College, Seattle/Tacoma, WA, June 21-22, 2019

#### Project Summary

StatPREP will foster the widespread use of data-centered methods and pedagogies
in introductory statistics courses. This will in turn enhance the preparation of
students to meet the demands of a data-driven workplace and to use the newly
available resources in our data-centric world. StatPREP will work directly with
college-level instructors, both online and in community-based workshops, to
develop the understanding and skills needed to work and teach with modern data.

StatPREP will initiate community transformation focused on modernizing undergraduate statistics education. This project will offer an extended professional development program for mathematics faculty, particularly at two-year institutions, who teach introductory statistics, it will establish regional communities of practice to support these instructors, and it will provide them a national online support network with statistics education experts. This project also contributes to the goal to â€œimprove STEM learning and learning environments by investigating the effectiveness of this professional development model as a catalyst for community transformation. The combined resources and reach of the MAA, ASA, and AMATYC will ensure the sustainability of StatPREP and the availability of this program to the largest possible audience.


### rstudio.cloud

You (and your students) can set up accounts with <https://rstudio.cloud/>.
This is the easiest way to get going with R since no one needs to install or 
pay for anything.

This online version of RStudio is a new service and still under development.
Currently it is free.  Eventually there may be both free and paid plans.


### Running R Locally

You are welcome to work in your own local copy of R and RStudio if you prefer.  This will work best if you have a recent versions 

  * [R](http://cran.r-project.org)
  * [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)
  * the [`mosaic`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`ggformula`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package and its dependencies
  
Packages can be installed or updated using the Packages tab in RStudio.


### Setting up your own RStudio Server  

 * If you ask, RStudio will provide you with the professional server for free for qualifying academic purposes.  Contact them for details to see if you qualify.
 
 * If you want to serve tutorials, you will also need to set up RStudio Connect (and maybe a shiny server).  These aren't any harder than setting up RStudio Server, but they are separate software installs.
 
 * RStudio has lots of documentation about how to install and configure. For example, here is the [RStudio Server Pro admin guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/)
 
 * Here's a [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-get-your-very-own-rstudio-server-and-shiny-server-with-digitalocean/) discussing how to do this with Digital Ocean.

 * Here's a [blog post](http://amunategui.github.io/EC2-RStudioServer/) about doing this with AWS.
