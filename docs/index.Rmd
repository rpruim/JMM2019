## Cheat Sheets

R Studio is assembling a number of useful cheat sheets at [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
   
## Running R Locally

You are welcome to work in your own local copy of R and RStudio if you prefer.  This will work best if you have a recent versions 

  * [R](http://cran.r-project.org)
  * [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)
  * the [`mosaic`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`ggformula`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package and its dependencies
  
Packages can be installed or updated using the Packages tab in RStudio.


## Setting up your own RStudio Server  

 * If you ask, RStudio will provide you with the professional server for free for qualifying academic purposes.  Contact them for details to see if you qualify.
 
 * If you want to serve tutorials, you will also need to set up RStudio Connect (and maybe a shiny server).  These aren't any harder than setting up RStudio Server, but they are separate software installs.
 
 * RStudio has lots of documentation about how to install and configure. For example, here is the [RStudio Server Pro admin guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/)
 
 * Here's a [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-get-your-very-own-rstudio-server-and-shiny-server-with-digitalocean/) discussing how to do this with Digital Ocean.

 * Here's a [blog post](http://amunategui.github.io/EC2-RStudioServer/) about doing this with AWS.
