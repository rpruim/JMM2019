#### Welcome

  * [Welcome Slides](welcome/JMM2019-welcome.html)

#### Less Volume, More Creativity

  * Slides
      * [[HTML]](less-volume/less-volume-slides.html)
      * [[Rmd]](less-volume/less-volume-slides.Rmd)

      * [at rsconnect.calvin.edu](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu/less-volume/jmm2019)
      * [at shinyapps.io](https://rpruim.shinyapps.io/Less-Volume-JMM2019/)
      * [Google presentation with example plots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11w4jK-PLc_v7Sm0gNcj5mAyHA8uyDWU7VTlYBjN9oks/edit?usp=sharing).

#### rstudio.cloud

[rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) provides access to an online version of RStudio.

* Free version has some limitations, but is enough to get you started
    
* Create and account at <https://login.rstudio.cloud/login>
    
* Click on [this project link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/172687) to get started.
    
    * Note: It can take a few minutes to create a new project.  Be patient.
        
    * Once you are there, trying creating a plot by typing a command in the 
        "console".
        
    * If you want to save your work, be sure to save a copy.
        
    * We'll learn more about how to use rstudio.cloud tomorrow.
        
       
#### Additional Resources
  
  * In case you want to learn more about how to produce plots, here are some
  additional tutorials
  
    * Refining ggformula plots: 
        * [at rsconnect.calvin.edu](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu/ggformula/refining/)
        * [at shinyapps.io](https://rpruim.shinyapps.io/Refining_ggformula/)
  
    * Graphs with ggformula: <http://shiny.grinnell.edu/Tutorials/GraphsWithggformula/>
    
### Day 2: R Markdown for Instructors and Students

#### Goals for the day

* See the importance of a reproducible workflow.

* Learn how students and instructors can make use of RMarkdown to create
documents and webpages that include text, R code, R output, and graphics.

#### Resources

## Additional Resources and Information

<!-- ## R Studio Server -->

<!-- You are welcome to use an account on Calvin's RStudio server using the username and password  -->
<!-- provided.  Here's the link to get there. -->

<!--   * [rstudio.calvin.edu](http://rstudio.calvin.edu) -->

<!-- These accounts will likely be recycled in May or June, 2018. -->

### Cheat Sheets

R Studio is assembling a number of useful cheat sheets at [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

### rstudio.cloud

You (and your students) can set up accounts with <https://rstudio.cloud/>.
This is the easiest way to get going with R since no one needs to install or 
pay for anything.

This online version of RStudio is a new service and still under development.
Currently it is free.  Eventually there may be both free and paid plans.


### Running R Locally

You are welcome to work in your own local copy of R and RStudio if you prefer.  This will work best if you have a recent versions 

  * [R](http://cran.r-project.org)
  * [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)
  * the [`mosaic`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`ggformula`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic) package and its dependencies
  * the [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package and its dependencies
  
Packages can be installed or updated using the Packages tab in RStudio.


### Setting up your own RStudio Server  

 * If you ask, RStudio will provide you with the professional server for free for qualifying academic purposes.  Contact them for details to see if you qualify.
 
 * If you want to serve tutorials, you will also need to set up RStudio Connect (and maybe a shiny server).  These aren't any harder than setting up RStudio Server, but they are separate software installs.
 
 * RStudio has lots of documentation about how to install and configure. For example, here is the [RStudio Server Pro admin guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/)
 
 * Here's a [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-get-your-very-own-rstudio-server-and-shiny-server-with-digitalocean/) discussing how to do this with Digital Ocean.

 * Here's a [blog post](http://amunategui.github.io/EC2-RStudioServer/) about doing this with AWS.
