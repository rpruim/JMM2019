# Participants

## Hello, my name is ...

Take a moment to introduce yourself 

  * to **at least THREE** people,
  * who are sitting **near you**, but
  * whom you **do not already know**.
  
Things you might share about yourself:

  * name, institution, 
  * why you are in this minicourse 
  * favorite hobby 
  * something on the JMM program you are looking forward to

## How much have we used R?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_counts(~ R.prof, data = S %>% filter(keep), 
          fill = ~ course, show.legend = TRUE) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "tidyverse proficiency")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggformula)
gf_counts(~ R.prof, data = S, fill = ~ course)
```

## How much have we used tidyverse?


```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_counts(~ tidyverse.prof, data = S %>% filter(keep), 
          fill = ~ course, show.legend = TRUE) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "tidyverse proficiency")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggformula)
gf_counts(~ tidyverse.prof, data = S, fill = ~ course)
```

## When do we fill out surveys?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
d1 <- lubridate::mdy_hms("jan-09-2019 11:24:00am")
d2 <- lubridate::mdy_hms("jan-13-2019 01:02:00am")
gf_histogram( ~ time, data = S %>% filter(keep), 
              boundary = min(S$time),
              binwidth = lubridate::hours(3)) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = d1, color = "red", size = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = d2, color = "red", size = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) %>% 
  gf_labs(x = "survey submission time (EST)")

# What is tidyverse?

## Less Volume, More Creativity

"Less Volume, More Creativity" can serve as a guiding principle to
select and R toolkit that is 

* small (fewer commands/ideas/structures is better)
* coherant (components play well together)
* powerful (gets the job done)

### Examples

  * `mosaic` (and `ggformula`) for numerical and graphical summaries, modeling
  * `R Markdown` for document creation
  * `dplyr`/`tidyverse` for data transformation

## What is tidyverse?

* A collection of packages by Hadley Wickham (and friends)
  * goal: solve important data analysis problems in a coherent, systematic way

* `dplyr` and `tidyr`: parts of this toolkit devoted to data transformation

  * useful for preparing "found data" for your students
  * useful for combining data from multiple sources
  * useful for rearranging data to make it more convenient to work with
  
* `tidyverse` is quite large, but its components can be added one by one,
and since they play well together, the marginal cost of adding a new 
tools to the toolkit is low.

## Let's give it a try

Running the `learnr` tutorial

* links available at <https://rpruim.github.io/JMM2019/>

* interactive tutorials available on two servers (at Calvin and at RStudio)

* also links to the source (Rmd) file that you can download and run
locally 

    * avoid network latency issues
    * see how the tutorials are created
    * requires that `learnr` (and some other R packages) be 
    installed on your system
