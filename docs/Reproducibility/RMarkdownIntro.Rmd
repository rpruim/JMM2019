## Growing Demand for Statistics
McKinsey & Company (Manyika et al., 2011) has predicted shortfalls of 150,000 data analysts and 1.5 million managers who are knowledgeable about data and their relevance.

## Reproducibility

Reproducibility is the ability for a study or experiment to be duplicated. 

## Reproducibility: Science Isn't Broken (fivethirtyeight.com)

"Nosek's team invited researchers to take part in a crowdsourcing data analysis project. The setup was simple. Participants were all given the same data set and prompt: **Do soccer referees give more red cards to dark-skinned players than light-skinned ones?** They were then asked to submit their analytical approach for feedback from other teams before diving into the analysis.

Twenty-nine teams with a total of 61 analysts took part. The researchers used a wide variety of methods, ranging - for those of you interested in the methodological gore - from simple linear regression techniques to complex multilevel regressions and Bayesian approaches. They also made different decisions about which secondary variables to use in their analyses."

How can you use p-values in multiple regression to prove or disprove the relationship between:

- smoking cigarettes and lung cancer
- vaccines and autism
- the pesticide DDT and birth defects
- anthropogenicly-generated greenhouse gasses and climate change

How can you use p-values in multiple regression to prove or disprove the relationship between:

- smoking cigarettes and lung cancer
- vaccines and autism
- the pesticide DDT and birth defects
- anthropogenicly-generated greenhouse gasses and climate change


With large datasets, we can almost always find "significant results" to support our conclusions.

He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts - for support rather than for illumination.

When a measure becomes a target, it is no longer a measure.

Analysis of more than 4,000 studies of neurological diseases suggest that the published work - some of which was used to justify human clinical trials - is biased towards reporting positive results.

"We know that as much as 30 percent of the most influential original medical research papers later turn out to be wrong or exaggerated."
